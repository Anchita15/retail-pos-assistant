# Coupon Rules

Coupons help drive sales, but they must follow store policies and system rules.

## General Rules
- Coupons must be applied **before final payment**.
- The system accepts both **digital** (app, email, SMS) and **paper** coupons.
- Coupons must have a valid **expiration date** and **store ID**.

## Restrictions
- Limit one coupon per item, unless otherwise specified.
- Coupons cannot be combined with **employee discounts**.
- “Buy One Get One” (BOGO) offers only apply to eligible SKUs.
- Manufacturer coupons cannot exceed the selling price of the item.

## Troubleshooting
- If a coupon is rejected, verify:
  - Item SKU matches coupon eligibility.
  - Coupon has not expired.
  - Coupon was not already used.
